In this folder are MATLAB files for the analysis of fTCD blood flow 
data. 

From matlab run > deaf_hearing_shared_analysis.m

Note: This is the analysis code only. You will need to direct it towards 
.exp files and check that the same settings apply to your recorded fTCD 
data (e.g. columns with trigger codes, manual epoch screening, etc).
